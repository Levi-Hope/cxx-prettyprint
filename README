cxx-prettyprint
===============

A pretty printing library for C++ containers.

Synopsis:
  Simply by including this header-only library in your source file,
  you can say "std::cout << x" for any container object x. Sensible
  defaults are provided, but the behaviour (i.e. the delimiters) are
  compile-time customizable to a great extent via partial specializiation.

For details, please see the website (http://louisdx.github.com/cxx-prettyprint/).

Language requirements: C++0x

(A modified version that works for C++98/03 should be very easy to derive.)
